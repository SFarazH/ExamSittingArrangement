Here are few instructions and a guide for accessing the code.

User is supposed to input 2 types of files
They are:-
1. Class Occupancy file ->It will include class,occupancy in a comma separate way.
The file should be .txt extension file. 

2.Section file ->It will contain roll numbers of the students to be seated. 
The file name should be section_name.txt

For saving the files in the system a dialogue would pop up after inputing the files.
 Here you are expected to enter the file name with txt extension.
